This repository contains the code samples for the ironruby in action book from Manning.

The folders Chapter 1-3 have filenames that correspond to listing numbers in the book.
if you want to run them navigate into the folder and execute the command ir <<filename.rb>>.

Chapter 7 is a very small rails application but it won't run on IronRuby at the moment. You can test it with MRI
